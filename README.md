Creality cr10-v3 Cura profile

Hello, I'm new on this platform.
I have a problem with my cr10-v3. If I print bigger parts like a Mandalorian helmet part the part gets frayed and inaccurate. Is someone here who has the same printer and can share their cura-profile with me? I can't find any on the internet..

Thank you very much
